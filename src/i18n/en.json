  "faq": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions About Islamic Inheritance",
    "q1": {
      "question": "Why is a man's share greater than a woman's?",
      "answer": "In Islam, a man bears financial responsibility for the family (nafaqa), including supporting his wife, children, and parents. A woman is not obligated to spend her wealth on the family — it is her personal property. Therefore, the man's larger share compensates for his obligations."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Which Quran verses establish the heirs' shares?",
      "answer": "The main verses about inheritance are in Surah an-Nisa: verses 11, 12, and 176. They establish the shares of children, parents, spouses, and siblings."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Can a murderer inherit?",
      "answer": "No. According to the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ: 'The killer does not inherit' (Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah). This rule protects against crimes committed for inheritance."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Do Muslims and non-Muslims inherit from each other?",
      "answer": "According to the majority of scholars — no. The Prophet ﷺ said: 'A Muslim does not inherit from a kafir, and a kafir does not inherit from a Muslim' (Bukhari, Muslim)."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "Where does the grandmother's share (1/6) come from?",
      "answer": "The grandmother's share is established by the Sunnah. It is narrated that a grandmother came to the Prophet ﷺ asking about her share, and he allocated 1/6 to her (Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi)."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "What to do if the sum of shares exceeds 100%?",
      "answer": "The rule of al-awl is applied — proportional reduction of all shares. This decision was made by Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab and approved by the companions."
    },
    "q7": {
      "question": "How is inheritance distributed when there are no heirs?",
      "answer": "If there are no heirs from ashab al-furud, asaba, or dhawil-arham, the property goes to the Muslim treasury (bayt al-mal) for public needs."
    },
    "q8": {
      "question": "What is the order of actions when distributing inheritance?",
      "answer": "1) Burial expenses, 2) Payment of the deceased's debts, 3) Execution of the will (up to 1/3), 4) Distribution of the remainder among heirs."
    },
    "q9": {
      "question": "Why is it important to study ilm al-faraid?",
      "answer": "The Prophet ﷺ said: 'Learn the science of inheritance and teach it, for it is half of knowledge' (Ibn Majah). Proper distribution of inheritance is an obligation of Muslims."
    },
    "q10": {
      "question": "Can one refuse their share of inheritance?",
      "answer": "Yes, an heir can voluntarily refuse their share in favor of other heirs or give it as sadaqa. The main thing is that it must be a voluntary decision."
    },
    "q11": {
      "question": "Why are brothers divided into full, paternal, and maternal?",
      "answer": "This affects their inheritance rights. Full brothers (same father and mother) have priority. Paternal brothers (same father) inherit in the absence of full brothers. Maternal brothers (same mother) have special rules and inherit only in kalala."
